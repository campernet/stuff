## ðŸ”Œ Pin Mapping

| ESP32 Pin | BME280 Pin | Function        |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| GPIO 2    | SDA        | IÂ²C data        |
| GPIO 0    | SCL        | IÂ²C clock       |
| 3V3       | VIN        | Power supply    |
| GND       | GND        | Ground          |

No pull-up resistors were required in this build. Behavior may vary by board.
